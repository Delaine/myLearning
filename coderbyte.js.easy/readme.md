This is a folder full of my solutions to CoderByte's easy challenges. Their "analyze your code" feature doesn't work, so you can't just look at my solutions by visiting my CoderByte profile.

Some challenges are so incredibly easy that I didn't bother to save the code I wrote. For example, the Check Nums challenge is straightforward `if` statements.

Some challenges were way harder than I would expect for an "easy" puzzle. Oftentimes, I could easily think of a general algorithm or psuedocode, but it took me awhile to finish the code because of my lack of JavaScript-specific expertise. I also didn't know **Regular Expressions** before visiting CoderByte, so I learned the basics of `RegExp`s via Google. If you're a noob, let me just tell you it really helps if you know that `/[A-Za-z]/.test(charToBeTested)` checks to see whether or not a given character is part of the alphabet.
